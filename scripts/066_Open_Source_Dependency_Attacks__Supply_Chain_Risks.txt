Narrator: "Before we delve deeper into the dangers, let's set the stage with some background information."

[Background/Context]
Narrator: "Open source software has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing developers to collaborate, innovate, and share code freely. However, this openness comes at a costâ€”a vulnerability that cybercriminals exploit through what's known as supply chain attacks."

Narrator: "In a supply chain attack, cybercriminals target the software supply chain to compromise the code and inject malicious components. One of the most insidious forms of these attacks is through open source dependencies, where hackers exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or modules used by developers."

Narrator: "Now, let's unravel the main narrative behind open source dependency attacks and the steps involved in this perilous journey."

[Main Narrative: Step-by-Step]
Narrator: "Step 1: Infiltration. Hackers identify vulnerable open source dependencies within popular libraries or frameworks, knowing that these weaknesses can serve as entry points into unsuspecting systems."

Narrator: "Step 2: Manipulation. Once the vulnerable dependencies are identified, cybercriminals inject malicious code or backdoors into these components, essentially poisoning the software supply chain from within."

Narrator: "Step 3: Distribution. The compromised open source dependencies are then distributed through legitimate channels, such as package managers or repositories, where unsuspecting developers unknowingly integrate them into their projects."

Narrator: "Step 4: Activation. The malicious code lies dormant within the software until triggered by a specific condition or command, allowing the attacker to remotely execute malicious actions, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations."

Narrator: "Step 5: Exploitation. With the trap set, cybercriminals exploit the compromised software to launch a variety of attacks, ranging from data breaches and ransomware infections to system takeovers and sabotage."
