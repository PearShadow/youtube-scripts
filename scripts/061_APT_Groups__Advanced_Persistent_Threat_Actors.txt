Narrator: To understand the world of APT Groups, let's first delve into some background and context. These threat actors employ advanced techniques, including custom malware, social engineering, and zero-day exploits to infiltrate target networks and systems. They operate with the goal of stealing sensitive information, disrupting operations, or even carrying out sabotage.
