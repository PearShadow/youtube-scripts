Narrator: Meet Sarah, a busy professional who receives an urgent email from what appears to be her bank. The email claims that there has been suspicious activity on her account and prompts her to click on a link to verify her information. Sarah, feeling anxious about her financial security, clicks on the link without giving it a second thought.

Narrator: Little does Sarah know that the email was a cleverly disguised phishing attempt. By clicking on the link, she unknowingly gives the cyber-criminal access to her sensitive banking details. And just like that, Sarah falls victim to a phishing scam.

Narrator: But fear not, there are telltale signs that can help you identify phishing scams before it's too late. Let's explore some key indicators that can help you spot the bait.

[Transition to a list of key indicators with visuals]

[3:00]
Narrator: Key Indicator #1: Check the sender's email address. Cyber-criminals often use email addresses that mimic legitimate companies but have subtle variations like misspellings or extra characters. Always verify the sender's email address before clicking on any links or providing personal information.

Narrator: Key Indicator #2: Look out for grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the email content. Phishing emails are often riddled with spelling mistakes and poor grammar. Legitimate companies usually have proofread content, so be wary of any emails that seem hastily put together.

Narrator: Key Indicator #3: Be cautious of unsolicited requests for personal information. Legitimate companies rarely ask for sensitive information like passwords or account details via email. If you receive such requests out of the blue, it's a red flag that you may be dealing with a phishing scam.

Narrator: Key Indicator #4: Hover over links to reveal the actual URL. Cyber-criminals often disguise malicious links by displaying a legitimate URL in the email. By hovering over the link, you can see the actual destination. If the URL looks suspicious or unrelated to the sender, don't click on it.

Narrator: Key Indicator #5: Analyze the tone and context of the email. Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or panic to prompt immediate action. If an email pressures you to act quickly or threatens dire consequences, take a step back and assess the situation calmly.
