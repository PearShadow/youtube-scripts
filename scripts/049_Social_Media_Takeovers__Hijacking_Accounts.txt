But how did this happen? Social media takeovers can occur through various means, such as phishing emails, weak passwords, or even through unsecured Wi-Fi networks. In Sarah's case, the hacker had gained access to her account by tricking her into clicking on a malicious link that prompted her to enter her login credentials.
